description: Tired of complex headless CMS setups? Learn how I use Obsidian's plugins to write, commit, and deploy blog posts seamlessly.
---

Every year or two, I go through the process of attempting to resurrect my blog. I fiddle with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and host it on Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare, and then, inevitably, I hit the same wall: figuring out how to manage the content. I end up getting lost exploring headless, git-based and API-driven CMS systems and trying to put everything together in a nice cohesive way. 

I have to do a fair amount of writing at work and I've realised that I am most productive when I write in a clean, minimalistic editor that has few (visible) bells and whistles and UI elements that call for my attention. The closer I can get to a blank white page, the better quality my writing and the longer I can focus on it.

The tool that has best served me in this regard is Obsidian. Simply put, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a markdown-based note taking app. It runs locally on your device and stores the content directly in your filesystem. It is hugely customisable - there are a wide variety of community plugins available and if you are comfortable with JavaScript, you can write your own plugins to do pretty much anything! 

As I was busy with this blog resurrection attempt, I had an idea: what if I could use Obsidian directly as the CMS for my blog? The web framework I am using, Astro, already has excellent support for markdown files. I could simply open the */content/blog* directory on my [website](https://github.com/JasonTame/website) in Obsidian and write my content directly from there, no fancy Git-backed CMS needed.

What's more, with the wide variety of plugins available, I could probably handle every aspect of publishing and deploying changes directly from Obsidian, without ever needing to open up a terminal or my IDE. 

This post is my first attempt at using this workflow, and thus far I am pretty satisfied with the results.
### Managing source control

I need to be able to commit the changes to my blog post markdown files and push them up to GitHub in order to trigger a new website build. I don't want to handle this manually in a terminal or open up my IDE to do it - I want to be able to do this from commands in Obsidian directly.

I've installed the [Git community plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git), which allows me to run git commands directly from Obsidian. I simply 'stage' my new post with the *Git: Stage current file* command

![git stage](https://pub-1acda13702cb4456a705c8661dafadca.r2.dev/images/git_stage.png)

And then commit my changes, using either the *Git: Commit staged* option (which will add a generic commit message) or the *Git: Commit staged with specific message* option if I want to be a bit more specific.

![git commit message](https://pub-1acda13702cb4456a705c8661dafadca.r2.dev/images/git_commit_message.png)

Finally, I can run *Git: Push* to sync my changes to my `main` branch on Github, which will trigger a new deployment on Cloudflare. 

And that's it - post published! üöÄ

## Managing images

One potential hurdle with git-based content workflows is handling images. You'll need to make them available somewhere so they can be referenced in your blog. The general approach is to use a service like https://imgur.com/ or https://cloudinary.com/ for this. Just like every other aspect of this new writing workflow, I wanted something that required minimal effort and would be managed directly within Obsidian.

Firstly, I set up a [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/) bucket for storing my images. I could have gone with Amazon S3 or ImageKit or any number of other providers, but my website is hosted on Cloudflare already, so I wanted to keep everything within that ecosystem. Once the R2 bucket was created and set up for public access, I installed the [Image Upload Toolkit](https://github.com/addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit) community plugin and added my bucket's API credentials. 

Now all I need to do is run the *Image Upload Toolkit: Publish Page* command, which will take all the images it finds in my post, store them in my R2 bucket, and update the URLs of the images so everything works as expected üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The local images stored in my vault are no longer referenced, so I can use the [Clear Unused Images](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=oz-clear-unused-images) plugin to delete them once I've finished writing my post.

## Summary

I'm sure there are a lot of niceties you get from a "proper" CMS that I am missing out on by relying entirely on Obsidian, but for now I am enjoying the simplicity and ease of this workflow. It's also nice to know that (aside from the images), I have full control and ownership of my content and I can change either the editing experience or the rendering experience whenever and however I like.
