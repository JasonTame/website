            So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? What do they got in there? King
            Kong? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry,
            and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Life
            finds a way. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God
            creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

            You really think you can fly that thing? You know what? It is beets.
            I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed
            with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso
            machine? Wh--what is--h--how did you get my espresso machine?

            Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet?
            Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! I was
            part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. You're a very
            talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you
            need a manager?

            Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes
            fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power

            man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

            Yes, Yes, without the oops! Do you have any idea how long it takes
            those cups to decompose. They're using our own satellites against
            us. And the clock is ticking. Do you have any idea how long it takes
            those cups to decompose. My dad once told me, laugh and the world
            laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you
