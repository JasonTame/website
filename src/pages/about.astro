        Hi, I'm Jason! I'm an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.offerzen.com" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-hover"
          >OfferZen</a
        >
        with a background in full-stack development and education. I'm based in Cape Town, South Africa 🌍

      <p class="mb-6">
        I initially started my career in education before moving into IT and finally software development. I spent 6+ years as a full-stack
        developer, mostly working with PHP (Laravel) on the backend and a variety of JavaScript frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue.js) on the
        frontend. I'm currently working as an engineering manager, which I find to be the perfect mix of technical and people skills.
      </p>
